    <h1>Implementations</h1>
    <ul>
		<p>I have implemented a renderer by following the book PBRT. It can do rasterization, 
		ray tracing and path tracing. I am planning to add bidirectional path tracing and 
		photon mapping in the near future. </p>
		<p>The path tracing is composed of direct and indirect lighting. Importance sampling is also 
		used during the sampling of the light source and direction. A cornell box example can be seen below.</p>

		<p>Missing parts are the bounding box volume hiearchy and antialiasing. I will add them soon. The code 
		for the implementation can be found on my github account: ... </p>
