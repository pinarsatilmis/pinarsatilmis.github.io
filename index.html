<h1>Implementations</h1>
	<ul>
	  <li>
		<p>I have implemented a renderer by following the book PBRT. It can do rasterization, 
		ray tracing and path tracing. I am planning to add bidirectional path tracing and 
		photon mapping in the near future. </p>
		  
		<p>The path tracing is composed of direct and indirect lighting. Importance sampling is also 
		used during the sampling of the light source and direction. A cornell box example can be seen below.</p>

		<p>Missing parts are the bounding box volume hiearchy and antialiasing. I will add them soon. Please contact me 
		for the code.</p>

    	    <p>Sky lighting is an important part of realistic rendering. But, memory consumption and evaluation speed can be a big concern 
	    especially in real time application. To overcome these drawbacks, in this research Artificial Neural Networks are 
	    investigated, since ANNs can learn a continuous function with a single hidden layer (the universal approximation theorem). 
            This makes them an efficient method to represent the lighting from Environment Maps (HDR images) and also analytical 
	    functions. Based on the universal approximation theorem, I have represented the skylighting with an eight dimensional 
	    feature vector. In this work, I did research on backpropagation algorithm. I have deep understanding of feedforward networks,
	    and impact of cost functions on the results. A juxtaposition example generated by the method can be seen in the 
	    following image:</p>
